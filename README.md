My decision to reboot own career &amp; learn Programming starts just over here.

Do or do not, there is no try.

It took more than six months of 2020 in my case, just to finally decide and start rebooting myself & my career.
I'm taking it for serious. It's no brainer any longer.

All the signs, all the facts, everything pushes me out from the place where I was.

Do or do not, there is no try.

Wojtek Nosal, who I treat as just a pure & close Friend, contributed strongly in this process. He actually inspired me the most. More to say: he gave me a Hope. Even if he's not fully aware of it. His words flowing throughout his answer was good enough. Or maybe to be more precise: I was desperatedly looking for such an answer.

Maybe you know that feeling? When you are feeling that there's some lack of inspiration, some lack of information. Such a small piece, just a very small piece that's missing to make a final step. To close the process. To start a new trip. Something that you know, that's still missing, but for some reason it's not coming to you anyhow. And finally, then you suddenly hear it, unexpectably. And deep inside yourself, you know it's done. You know it came, you know it just happened. You've grabbed it. It's now inside you and now your waiting & search ends, while the new one borned & launched. That's the Change. A Progress.

Just, how long shall you wait, feeling that the change has to take a place anyway? Short enough.

Thank you Wojtek. Thank you so much. Words cannot say how much.

Do or do not, there is no try.
